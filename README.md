# ITEMAL

ITEMAL performs item analyses of individual test questions as well as entire tests. It can be used to analyze data collected on optical scan sheets and already processed by the test scoring program or any scored test data that has been placed in a disk file.  This is a Python translation of the original _ancient_ Fortran code.
